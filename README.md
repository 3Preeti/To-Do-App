# TO-DO APP
## My TO-DO App

A simple, responsive ToDo list application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, styled with Bootstrap 5. This application allows users to add, delete, edit, and mark tasks as complete, with all data persistently stored in the browser's Local Storage.

## Features

- Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks using the input field.
- Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's Local Storage, so they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
- Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks using a prompt interface.
- Delete Tasks: Remove unwanted tasks permanently.
- Mark as Complete: Toggle the completion status of a task, which applies a "line-through" style.
- Responsive Design: Styled using Bootstrap 5 classes for a clean and mobile-friendly layout.
- Visual Icons: Uses Bootstrap Icons for a clear and intuitive user experience (Edit, Delete, and Complete buttons).

  ## Technologies Used

  - HTML5: Structure of the application (index.html).
  - CSS3: Custom styling (style.css).
  - JavaScript (Vanilla): Core application logic, DOM manipulation, and Local Storage management (script.js).
  - Bootstrap 5: For responsive layout, cards, forms, and general component styling.
  - Bootstrap Icons: For action button icons.
